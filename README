main: main function, used to test all subfunctions. for now, it will run demo function for each dataset in the data folder.
demo: nd-to-end demo of histogram estimation
read_original_data: script that is used to read raw data into SMAT form
calcEigen: naive function to calculate eigenvalue if .eig file is missing. Only suitable for 'not large' sparse matrixes
load_graph: interface used between demo and readSMAT/readSMATGZ/calcEigen. Will genertate eigenvalue .eig file if missing.
myCluster: naive clustering function.
MyTimer: a simple timer, called when execute functions.
putinGZ: function that compress raw data into gz file
readSMAT: a function that 
moments_cheb: estimate Chebyshev moments for the eigenvalue distribution
plot_chebint: plot the integral of the density estimate based on first-kind Chebyshev polynomials
compare_cheb: compare an eigenvalue histogram to the scaled density estimate based on the moments
compare_chebhist: compare an eigenvalue histogram to an estimated histogram based on integrating the first-kind Chebyshev density approximation
compare_chebhiste: like compare_chebhist, but uses reduced rank extrapolation to accelerate convergence of histogram bin values
filter_jackson: apply a Jackson filter to the polynomials
nadjacency: map adjacency to normalized adjacency

When running main.py, you may need to close the plotted graph in order to let the program to preceed.
